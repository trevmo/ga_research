# R Scripts

## Overview
These scripts were created to ease the process of analyzing the data collected in the research project. Each script was designed with a specific purpose in mind, whether that be:
- averaging data
- approximating a linear model of the data
- plotting averaged or raw data
- formatting plots

These scripts "get the job done" for this project, and I would recommend generalizing/optimizing them before trying to use them in another project.

### Side Note
I was learning R as I went in this project. As a result, you may notice varying levels of generalization and utilization of R-specific techniques. Utimately, the goal was simply to automate the data analysis, and the scripts could be further optimized with some more R experience.
